## Link test on 10-Jan-2014

We put two Atheros AR9271 USB WiFi boards back to back, seperated with about 12 meters of FSJ4-50B Heliax, and a
chain of attenuators to test the maximum link attenuation possible before the BER became unacceptable.

The purpose for the seperation was to prevent local RF leakage from the WiFi boards from sneaking in and helping
with the link and giving us false measurements. We did confirm that 12 meters was sufficient by placing terminators
on both boards with this seperation and confirming a link was not possible.

   * What was the acceptable BER?
   * What was the attenuation for that BER?
