## Test Description

We put two Atheros AR9271 USB WiFi boards back to back, seperated with about 12 meters
of FSJ4-50B Heliax, and a chain of attenuators to test the maximum link attenuation possible
before the BER became unacceptable.

The purpose for the seperation was to prevent local RF leakage from the WiFi boards from sneaking
in and helping with the link and giving us false measurements. We did confirm that 12 meters was
sufficient by placing terminators on both boards with this seperation and confirming a link was
not possible.
