DxWiFi
======

Repo for our Long Distance (also "long range") WiFi testing. The goal is to test out a WiFi-based communication system for amateur rockets, and possibly CubeSats.


Wiki Links on Wireless Configuration

From our PSAS wiki, mostly from the 2005 launch attempt:

World Record WiFi Attempts
--------------------------

Obviously, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-range_Wi-Fi) has an article on long distance WiFi, but it appears to be incorrect (let's fix that after some more digging).

There's a 2002/2003 Guiness Book of World Records entry for long range WiFi of 310 km by the Swedish Space Corporation, at least according to [this press release](http://www.alvarion.com/news-center-sp/global-press-releases/172-guiness-world-records-recognizes-worlds-longest-wi-fi-connection). Wikipedia claims it was 420 km, but that information seems to be wrong.

Going to [GBWR](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/) directly, we found that the [current world record is 382 km (237 miles)](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/2000/longest-broadband-wireless-connection), which was set in April 2007 by  Ermanno Pietrosemoli between two mountains in the Venezuelan Andes. He apparently got 3 Mbps, which is pretty good for 382 km!
